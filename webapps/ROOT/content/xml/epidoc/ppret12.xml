                <p>“Al nostro signore Costantino, eterno e clementissimo imperatore, Massimo Vincitore, sempre Augusto, Flavius Costantius, chiarissimo prefetto del pretorio, sempre devotissimo alla pietà sua.”</p>
            </div>
            <div type="commentary">
                <p>We know that the inscription was originally engraved on a rectangular marble block, but unfortunately we are without any photographic reproduction of it (although in 1875 Mortdmann sent one to von Domaszewski, Eph. Ep. V, 30, nr. 55); one rough facsimile is all we possess. 
                    The writing module is irregular and is characterized by a shallow carving of the letters. Although it is impossible to establish the dimensions of the support, through the height of the letters (the only recorded data), Mitchell and French (2019) estimate the inscription’s dimensions to be very similar to those of a second dedication from Ankara (<ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret13">PPRET 13</ref>), more recently discovered. This new inscription was also erected by the prefect Flavius Constantius in honour of the Emperor Constantine.</p>
                <p>According to Mitchell and French, the second inscribed base found at Ankara was chiselled on a re-used epigraphic field. In fact, if our inscription really is so similar to the second one from Ankara (<ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret13">PPRET 13</ref>) both in dimensions and chronology, then it is highly likely that the inscribed field of our marble base was re-used just like the other one.</p>
                <p>The inscription in question was discovered “when the “Banque Agricole” (Ziraat Bankasi) was built in Ulus” (see Jerphanion 1928, p. 234: «mis de côté lorsque fut construit l’édifice de la Banque Agricole, et qui avait, peut-être, été employé dans un cimitière»), in the second half of the 19th Century, between 1863 (creation of the Ziraat Bankasi) and 1875 (Eph. Ep. II, 1036, notified to Domaszewski and Mommsen were notified by the German orientalist Andreas David Mordtmann); Jerphanion saw it, but the stone was subsequently lost and its current location is unknown.</p>
                <p>Ulus is the historical center of Ankara and the original core of the Roman city of Ancyra, the capital of the province of Galatia (Haensch 1997, 277-281). Such a monumental inscription like this (if Mitchell’s assumption is true), must have occupied a very visible and important place within the city, such as the forum. 
                    Jerphanion (1928, p. 234) suggested that the marble base was reused: it may have been used in a cemetery or inserted into the lower town’s walls as spolia, preserving it at least until Jerphanion’s autopsy.</p>
                <p>The inscription put up by the praetorian prefect Constantius praises Emperor Constantine. The epithet <foreign>victor</foreign> is worthy of comment, since it replaced the word <foreign>invictus</foreign>, linked to the worship of <foreign>Sol Invictus</foreign>, which was at this point in contrast to imperial religious sensibility. The title <foreign>victor</foreign> was used continuously after Licinius’ defeat on September 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 324 AD, when Constantine, at the end of the civil war, presented himself as the final and only winner over his enemies. 
                    The portrait of the <foreign>triumphator</foreign> is, however, tempered by the attention to clemency and piety that characterized Constantine’s policy of reconciliation in the East. Indeed, the emperor was aware that Licinius’ eminent supporters would not only have to be pardoned, but also elevated, if necessary, to influential positions. 
                    The prefect’s devotion to <foreign>pietas</foreign> rather than <foreign>numen</foreign> represents another example of Constantine’s inclination towards reconciliation in areas that had only recently passed under his control and that required caution. The second Constantinian inscription from Ancyra (<ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret13">PPRET 13</ref>) glorifies Constantine’s <foreign>pietas</foreign>.</p>
                <p>The monument is dedicated only by Flavius Constantius and is very similar in its form and content to the collegial ones (<ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret01">PPRET 01</ref>; <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret02">2</ref>; <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret08">8</ref>; <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret09">9</ref>; <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret16">16</ref>; <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret17">17</ref>; <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret18">18</ref>). Porena (2003, pp. 392-393) gives two possible explanations for its creation: 
                    a) if the inscription was made to celebrate Constantine’s <foreign>Vicennalia</foreign> in 325 AD (when Flavius Constantius would appear to be the only member of the prefectural college), the monument could represent a surviving example of a series of monuments decreed by the prefect for this anniversary; 
                    b) the dedication may have been made shortly before the prefect’s departure in 327 AD, when Constantius was a member of a larger prefectural college, but he would have commissioned the monuments on his own in the regions for which he was responsible. The discovery of the second dedication from Ancyra (<ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret13">PPRET 13</ref>) strongly supports the first assumption. Similarly, Mitchell dated our dedications to the first weeks and months after the defeat of Licinius, because the inscriptions were intended to immediately publicize the political tenor of the new regime (see GLIA II, p. 72).</p>
                <p>Nothing is known of Flavius Constantius’ career. 
                    He is cited in eight imperial constitutions: the first (<ref type="source">CTh 15, 14, 01</ref>) and the last (<ref type="source">CTh 02, 24, 02</ref>) attest to him being praetorian prefect between December 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 324 AD and June 11<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 327 AD (see Porena 2003, pp. 382-386). He also held the consulate in 327 AD together with Valerius Maximus (CLRE, pp. 188-189). Since his previous career is unknown, we cannot establish when Flavius Constantius became <foreign>vir clarissimus</foreign>. According to Porena (2003, pp. 391-393) there are three possibilities: a) when he held the consulate (assuming he belonged to the equestrian order and that our inscription post dates 327 AD); b) he was of <foreign>clarissimus</foreign> rank before his consulate (if he was a relative of Constantine; see below); 
                    c) during Constantius’ tenure as praetorian prefect, since Constantine established that upon appointment praetorian prefects would automatically become <foreign>clarissimi</foreign>.</p>
                <p>Whatever the case may be, at least four inscriptions (also <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret13">PPRET 13</ref>; <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret14">14</ref>; <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret15">15</ref>) and eight Theodosian Constitutions attest Flavius Constantius as one of the major figures involved in the Constantinian reorganization of the East after the overthrow of Licinius’ regime. 
                    Two dedications from Ancyra (<ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret12">PPRET 12</ref> and <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret13">13</ref>) and another two, related to buildings (Aqaba military building, <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret14">PPRET 14</ref>; epigram for the Great Antioch’s Church, <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret15">PPRET 15</ref>) testify to his important role in the building policy of the East.</p>
                <p>Constantine entrusted Constantius with such important but thorny task that many scholars supposed kinship with the emperor’s family. The PLRE (p. 225) has identified Constantius with the homonymous envoy sent by Constantine between 315 and 316 AD to persuade Licinius to promote Bassianus (married to Constantine’s half-sister Anastasia) to the rank of Caesar before their first conflict (<ref type="source">Anon. Vales. 02, 14</ref>): the great deal of trust required for such a mission, supports the kinship theory. Chausson (2002, pp. 138, 145) suggested that Flavius Constantius could be Constantine’s legimitate brother (another son of Constantius I and Elena). Barnes (2011, p. 212, nt. 14) suggested that he was on a par with Iulius Constantius, son of Constantius I and Theodora, thus making him Constantine’s half-brother, although there is no evidence that he took the <foreign>nomen</foreign> Flavius.</p>
                <p>Porena agreed with Constantius’ identification in the PLRE and observed that he already must have been a trusted and experienced figure at that moment (perhaps in Constantine’s service before 324 AD), suitable to becoming Constatine’s praetorian prefect, when the second conflict with Licinius degenerated into open warfare. However, Porena also noted that Constantine and Constantius had to belong to the same generation and so his praetorian prefect could, in theory at least, be merely a cousin of the emperor.</p>
