                <p>The inscription is carved within a marble slab that was broken into two separated fragments and  joined to a golden bronze statue base. The slab was discovered by Waddington in Kythrea in Cyprus, but it is unfortunately now lost and there is no photographic reproduction of it, except for a fac-simile in CIL III, 214.</p> 
                <p>The inscription of Chytri records the erection of a gilded statue in honour of the praetorian prefect Flavius Philippus (PLRE I, pp. 696-697,) a prestigious reward for his virtuous devotion and self-sacriﬁce (for gilded statues to praetorian prefects, see <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret46">PPRET 46</ref>; <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret48">48</ref>; <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret51">51</ref>, Chytri is the oldest one; the first one was put up in 179/180 AD for M. Bassaeus Rufus in Trajan’s Forum, now CIL VI, 41141 = <ref corresp="http://www.edr-edr.it/edr_programmi/res_complex_comune.php?id_nr=EDR093411">EDR 093411</ref>; for late metallic statues see <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret24">PPRET 24</ref>; <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret57">57</ref>; <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret58">58</ref>).</p> 
                <p>Statues of Philippus were decreed by the Emperor Constantius II as a sign of gratitude for the former’s tireless work and the many risks the prefect had incurred. Apart from the recent discovery of the inscription at Perge (<ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret29">PPRET 29</ref>), the inscription from Chytri is the only one of series to have survived. Constantius II communicated his decision to offer gilded statues in honour of Philippus by means of a letter to his provincial administrators. A copy of this letter survives in an inscription of Ephesus (<ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret28">PPRET 28</ref>), and everything suggests that in many cities, the inscription on the statue base for Philippus and the copy of Constantius II’s letter to his administrators sat side by side.</p>   
                <p>Constantius’ decree ordered several golden statues of Philippus to be erected in the most prominent cities of the empire (<ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret28">PPRET 28</ref>, l. 31: <foreign>in opimis urbibus</foreign>), coinciding, in this case, with the eastern provinces (Ephesus, <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret28">PPRET 28</ref>; Perge, <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret29">PPRET 29</ref> and <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret31"> 31</ref>; Hierapolis, <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret30">PPRET 30</ref>) that were under Constantius’ control and that fell under Philippus’ prefecture. Since Chytri was a minor city tucked away in the hills of Cyprus, and since Constantius’ order specified “leading cities,” it has been assumed  - without any other supporting evidence - that Philippus must have been a native of the place in order to justify such a location (see Oliver, Swift 1962, p. 260). 
                    Since the criterion by which the cities were chosen it is not mentioned, the final decision may well have been left to the proconsul Marinus (Porena 2003, p. 495). Thanks to the recent discovery at Perge (<ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret29">PPRET 29</ref>) and the literary attestation of a statue from Chalcedon (see below,) it might be that these monuments were a little more widely spread than was first thought, so Chytri may not necessarily have anything to do with Philippus’ origin (see Ritti 2017, p. 649). It is possible that the two rectangular sections of our slab copied from Waddington, but deprived of the inner strip, were cut from a base originally placed, for example, in Salamina, and brought to Chytri as building material (Deligiannakis 2019, p. 766).</p> 
                <p>The inscription from Chytri summarizes the qualities of Philippus that were also celebrated in Constantius’ letter to Marinus from Ephesus (l. 6: <foreign>pro virtutum meritis et laborum</foreign>, cf. <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret28">PPRET 28</ref>, ll. 1 and 24 <foreign>virtus</foreign>; ll. 5 and 30 <foreign>merita</foreign>; ll. 5, 29, 36 <foreign>labor</foreign>). 
                    The inscriptions appear to be contemporaneous and ought to be dated to Constantius Gallus’ rule as Caesar (351-354 AD), whose name was erased at Chytri in or after 354 AD (see l. 4). The qualities of Philippus, glowingly described in the Ephesus letter, appear to be explicitly linked to the Chytri inscription (l. 7), which would have supported a statue of the dignitary, dressed in the praetorian prefect’s garb (for the use of <foreign>praefectura</foreign> to indicate the mandate of the honorand, see <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret16">PPRET 16</ref>, l. 3; 60, l. 4; 93 l. 31; <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret60">PPRET 60</ref>, l. 4).</p> 
                <p>According to Libanius, Flavius Philippus was of humble origins (<ref type="source">Lib., Or., 42, 24-25</ref>). Despite having a father who was merely a “sausage-maker” (ἐχόρδευεν,) Philippus was able to make his way into the Senate by virtue of his abilities as a shorthand writer. Under Constantius II it was not unknown for people of lower class to became senators because of their practical skills (Domitianus, Helpidius, Taurus and other praetorian prefects). Jones (1964, pp. 538-572), Dagron (1974, pp. 170-172) and recently Ritti (2017, p. 645,) have all pleaded for the creation of a new oriental aristocracy made up of members of the lower class. Such a thesis, based largely on the evidence of Libanius, has been attacked by Skinner (2013, pp. 17-53,) who challenges the idea of ial mobility, especially from the lower classes to the highest levels of the imperial administration in the East. As Rendina (2020, pp. 47-48) states, Philippus was an imperial <foreign>notarius</foreign> who played an increasingly crucial role in Constantius’ II court. Not only was his a position of great trust, it was a position that acquired ever greater significance under Constantine and Constantius II, which would, to some extent, explain his elevation to the praetorian prefecture.</p>
                <p>Nothing about his career before the prefecture is known. Thanks to Constantius II’s <foreign>Oratio ad Senatum</foreign> from Perge (see <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret31"> PPRET 31</ref>) still unpublished, we know that Philippus was also entrusted with the <foreign>cura palatii</foreign> under Constantine and continued his service under Constantius (Feissel 2016, p. 1124; Moser 2018, p. 106). 
                    Perhaps, he became Constantius’ close asiate and military consultant, when Constantine’s son was Caesar, then, much more when Philippus was appointed praetorian prefect, nearly ten years later. He is attested as praetorian prefect of the East from the end of 344 AD as can be deduced from rates’ (not explicitly dated) account (<ref type="source">Soc. 02, 16</ref>).
                    No later than the final months of 344 AD, did Philippus expel Paul, the orthodox bishop of Constantinople and install the arian Macedonius in his place, carrying out the pro-arian politics of Constantius II. How long his office lasted is a matter of debate. He still appeared to be in office in September 349 AD (<ref type="source">CTh 03, 13, 01</ref>; <ref type="source">CTh 08, 13, 01</ref>; <ref type="source">CTh 08, 13, 02</ref>; Cuneo 1997, pp. 188-190) and succeeded in combining his praetorian prefecture with the consulate in 348 AD (CLRE, pp. 230-231). He was still praetorian prefect in 350 AD, when he carried out his duty of προστασία concerning the approval and supervision of the restoration of the theatre of Hierapolis (τῶν ἱερῶν πραιτωρίων ἐπάρχου προστάξαντος, <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret30"> PPRET 30</ref>), a phase preceding the building works that continued until around 352 AD (for a contrary view see Ritti 2017, pp. 645-650, who assumed Philippus was in charge until the completion of the work, when the inscription and the prefect’s name were carved, and so also Moser 2018, pp. 204-205, see <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret30">PPRET 30</ref>).</p>  
                <p>In 351 AD, Zosimus (<ref type="source">Zos. 02, 46</ref>) attests to Philippus being at the side of Constantius II in Sirmium during the Illyrian war against the usurper Magnentius, but not as praetorian prefect (<ref type="source">Zos. 02, 46, 02</ref>: τῶν ἐν μεγίστοις ἀξιώμασιν ἄνδρα καὶ φρονήσει προέχοντα). With the two armies stuck in a stalemate, Constantius II sent Philippus as ambassador to the military camp of Magnentius in order to negotiate a peace settlement (actually a ruse to establish the size and moral of Magnentius’ army). 
                    Still according to Zosimus (<ref type="source">Zos. 02, 47</ref>), Philippus, conscious of his diplomatic immunity, went so far as to openly reproach Magnentius’s soldiers for their ingratitude towards Constantius, whereupon Magnentius had him taken prisoner, violating the ambassador’s immunity and breaking off negotiations in the process. When Philippus accompanied his master to Sirmium (probably as <foreign>comes</foreign>) he was no longer pratorian prefect of the East, since he would not have been to fulfill his functions while serving Constantius II in Pannonia. Someone must have immediately taken his place.</p>  
                <p>His successor could be Thalassius (PLRE I, p. 886), who, according to the <foreign>Passio Artemii</foreign> (<ref type="source">Pass. Art. 12</ref> = <ref type="source">Philost., 03, 26a</ref>), was appointed praetorian prefect of the East, before becoming, together with the <foreign>quaestor</foreign> Montius, the confidant and counsellor of Constantius Gallus (PLRE I, pp. 535-536; see Castello 2011, pp. 145-185) on March 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> 351 AD, when Gallus was elevated to Caesar. 
                    Nevertheless this literary source is in conflict with the account of Zosimus (<ref type="source">Zos. 02, 48, 05</ref>) who attests to Thalassius being an imperial <foreign>comes</foreign> (τὰ πρῶτα παρὰ βασιλεῖ φέροντες) at Constantius’ II camp in Sirmium immediately before the battle of Mursa (September 351 AD.) Apparently, it was during a banquet here, that the <foreign>comes</foreign> neglected to express his concern over Constantius’ acceptance of Magnentius’s treatment of the envoy Philippus (Drinkwater 2007, p. 147). In effect, both Ammianus (<ref type="source">Amm. 14, 01, 10</ref>) and Libanius (<ref type="source">Lib., Ep. 0016</ref>) only record the presence of Thalassius at Antioch as praetorian prefect of the East in 352 AD (Barnes 1992, p. 255). 
                    Since the <foreign>quaestura</foreign> of Montius Magnus is also dated to 352 AD by all the other literary sources and since the <foreign>Passio Artemii</foreign> righly indenties Thalassius and Montius’ offices but not their chronology, the dating of Thalassius’ prefecture is still open to debate (so Castello 2011, pp. 158-159). It is highly likely, however, that Thalassius was appointed in 352 AD, like Montius, when Constantius II left for the West and entrusted the Caesar Gallus (resident in Antioch) to their care. Therefore, provided that this reconstruction is correct, between the end of Philippus’ mandate and the beginning of that of Thalassius, perhaps there was another praetorian prefect for the East in 351 AD, whose name is unfortunately unknown.</p>
                <p>Philippus is not attested at his master’s side at the battle of Mursa (September 351 AD), where Constantius II finally defeated Magnentius, and the literary sources cease talking about him after his embassy. Only Athanasius (<ref type="source">Athan., Hist. Ar. 07</ref>) claims that Philippus was deposed and that he died destitute and in exile, after he himself had been responsible for exiling (350 AD) and killing (351 AD) Paul the Bishop of Constantinople. Given Athanasius’ hostility to Constantius in the Arian controversy the veracity of this account is questionable. Indeed, many scholars have hypothesized that the unfortunate prefect actually died at the hands of Magnentius, or perhaps that he was killed trying to escape from the camp, or even that Constantius himself had had a role in his death, believing that Philippus (due to his absence) had betrayed him during his diplomatic mission.  As a consequence some scholars have concluded that the honors and statues Philippus received were only posthumous monuments in order to restore his’reputation once the emperor changed his mind (Jones 1955, p. 232; AE 1973, 525; Vogler 1979, p. 137, PLRE I, p. 696; Kelly 2004, p. 189; Maraval 2013, p. 190; Deligiannakis 2018, pp. 33-34).</p>
                <p>Actually, the recent epigraphic evidence concerning Flavius Philippus contradicts Athanasius, as does our inscription from Chytri. Indeed, we can find no evidence of any posthumous rehabilitation in any of the inscriptions, as one would expect for such a public act (see Moser 2018, p. 202). If Philippus was heaped in praise and had golden statues erected in his honour it was simply because Constantius II (and Gallus Caesar) deemed him worthy of them. Thanks to the <foreign>Oratio ad Senatum</foreign> from Perge (<ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret31">PPRET 31</ref>), Feissel (2016, p. 1124) clarifies that his merits were related to the courageous role he played during the campaign against Magnentius. Probably in the immediate aftermath of the battle of Mursa, Constantius II ordered the erection of this series of statues to Flavius Philippus.</p>  
                <p>Indeed, another proof of his enduring fame is given by the 6th Century antiquarian John Lydus, who reported that a statue in military garb (with the <foreign>gladius</foreign>) of Philippus could still to be seen in Chalchedon (<ref type="source">Lyd., Mag., 02, 09, 06</ref>):</p>
                
                <p>“Ξίφος δὲ διεζώννυτο ἀνέκαθεν ὁ ὕπαρχος, οἷα καὶ τῶν ὅπλων ἔχων τὴν δύναμιν· καὶ τοῦτο δυνατὸν αὐταῖς ὄψεσιν ἐπί τοῦ παρόντος εὑρεῖν εἴ γέ τις φιλάρχαιος ὢν ἐπί τὴν Καλχηδόνα περαιωθεὶς τὴν Φιλίππου τοῦ ὑπάρχου εἰκόνα καταμάθοι.”</p> 
                
                <p>“From the beginning the prefect girded himself with a sword inasmuch, in fact, he had power over arms; and this can be found out at the present time with one’s very eyes if, that is, one who is a lover of antiquities should cross over to Chalchedon and observe the statue of Philippus the prefect.” (transl. Bandy 1983, pp. 96-99)</p> 
                <p>This passage demonstrates once again that Philippus did not suffer any misfortune and his statues were still exhibited almost two centuries later. Unlike most of the non-imperial late antique statues, the one of Philippus is represented not in <foreign>habitus civilis</foreign>, but girthed in the military belt with an attached sword, a direct reference to the original military duties of a praetorian prefect (for <foreign>civili habitu</foreign> see <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret24">PPRET 24</ref>; <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret75">PPRET 75</ref>). 
                    On the basis of this source, Moser assumes that the military appearance of this particular statue was limited to this city (2018, p. 206), although it is equally possible that the Constantinian decree demanded militaristic statues as a symbol of imperial military might. When placed in the context of the civil war and all the precarity that went with it, such a series of public monuments demonstrates how important such figures were in propping up the imperial cause. 
                If our dating is correct, then Philippus had already ceased being praetorian prefect when he received these honours and had already completed his dangerous embassy to Magnentius. Philippus was portrayed as praetorian prefect because the office was the highest position he acquired during his career. Such honours also underline just how important the praetorian prefecture was in the 4th Century. The appointment demanded a great deal of trust, carried with it huge responsibilities and was not without danger. The heroic Philippus is thus represented as a ‘fighting’ prefect, at the top of his senatorial career, the right hand man of Constantius II. As a consequence, his statues were intended to inspire others to emulate his loyalty and faith and in so doing receive rewards for their devotion towards emperors.</p>   
                <p>We actually do not know if, after his embassy, Philippus died and was rewarded for his sacrifice with this series of monuments or if he was freed and reunited with his master as Moser assumes (2018, p. 202). That Philippus survived might be deduced from the imperial letter of Ephesus in which, in some passages, the present tense is used. For a reconstruction of the last years of his life, see Moser (2018, pp. 203-205). According to Moser, although Philippus survived his imprisonment at the hands of Magnentius and was thus able to follow his master to Gauls in 353 AD, he died in disgrace, after being convicted of treason, after the final victory of Constantius II.</p> 
                <p>Flavius Philippus had important descendants: his nephew Anthemius was the praetorian prefect of the East (405-414 AD), the grandson of whom would be Procopius Anthemius, Western Roman Emperor from 467 to 472 AD (for a detailed study, see Rendina 2020, pp. 50-71).</p>
