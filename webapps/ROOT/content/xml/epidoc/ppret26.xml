            <div type="commentary">
                <p>Our Greek and Latin epitaphs most likely originate from the same building, the Ma’aref at Buşr al-Hariri, on the plateau of Trachôn (Syria), one of the many villages in this rural area. This elongated and polished building, now partially destroyed (only two corner and some other pieces survive; for more details see Sartre-Fauriat 2001, pp. 53-56) is made of basalt blocks. 
                    The Latin epitaph is now lost but probably was on a cartouche above a vaulted apse (perhaps on the building’s gate); the Greek one is visible still today on two blocks on the top of each other in the middle of the external wall.</p>
                <p>Some travellers and scholars saw these inscriptions during their journeys in the 19th Century. 
                    William John Bankes (1786-1855), Egyptologist and collector of fine arts, visited Buşr al-Hariri in 1816 (Sartre-Fauriat 2004, 152-155) and only copied the Latin inscription, because he was interested in its particular paleographic shape (see IGLS XV.1, 242 for Bankes’ fac-simile). 
                    The British antiquarian noted that it was chiselled in a cartouche above a vaulted apse with a simple moulded frame. Waddington in 1861 saw both inscriptions in the same building, a building he described as a “little church” (see Waddington 1870, p. 566). 
                    Then Von Oppenheim copied only a part of the Greek inscription together with another one (W 2472; IGLS XV.1, 251) as if they were a whole. In his opinion these texts were on an external wall of a majestic building, “a castle” with pillars and arches (Von Oppenheim 1899, pp. 183-185). Thanks to Sartre-Fauriat we know that these two texts were on the same wall of our building, but mounted separately and at a distance (the second one – IGLS XV.1, 251 – is to the right of our Greek one, at the base of a pillar; see Sartre-Fauriat 2014, p. 305).</p>
                <p>The nature of the building is unknown, but its architectonic style dates it to the 2nd-3rd Century AD, before the epitaphs were written. Sartre-Fauriat suggested that the building had been destroyed and rebuilt several times during the 19th Century and that the blocks were robbed from another building, which would help to explain the traveller’s contradictory versions about the building and the inscriptions within it (see Sartre-Fauriat 2001, p. 56; 2014, p. 308). 
                    However, the hypothesis of repair with reused blocks is unlikely due to: a) the dating of the building (2nd-3rd Century AD) before the inscriptions were put up (4th Century AD); b) the position of the Greek inscription in the middle of the wall; c) the neat distribution of the text on several blocks: it is hard to believe that those basalt blocks were moved in order to be reused, preserving the integrity of the text. The building housing the inscriptions was almost certainly the same building where the epitaphs were originally engraved.</p>
                <p>Indeed, in this area of the Hauran another twenty or so epigrams (all similar to ours) were discovered, all of them relating to monumental burials of wealthy local families. Maiorinus’ nephew Philippus composed these epitaphs. 
                    He also constructed a majestic grave in a rural <foreign>praedium</foreign> in honour of his distinguished relative, a member of an aristocratic family tied to the Trachon plateau, no doubt through its origins and properties. This rural <foreign>praedium</foreign>, far from the city, could be an example of an isolated, abandoned necropolis: the perimeter walls of the building remained in place and the inscriptions on them survived until the modern age.</p>
                <p>These two epitaphs are addressed to the same man, the praetorian prefect Maiorinus (PLRE I, pp. 537-538; Petit 1994, pp. 152-153), and put up by the same dedicant, his nephew Philippus. Maiorinus probably had aristocratic origins and would appear to originate from the eastern part of the empire (in Syria according to the epitaph and the correspondence of Libanius). He may have  held the praetorian prefecture (very probably of the East) between 344 and 346 AD. Nothing is known about his career. 
                    No source allows to establish the chronology of his praetorian prefecture nor its administrative area. He is mentioned in Libanius’ letters, but his prefecture would appear to be already finished when these letters were written, at the latest in 357 AD. 
                    By that time Maiorinus had held a series of unspecified offices (<ref type="source">Lib., Ep. 0560</ref> [357 AD], <ref type="source">Lib., Ep. 1510</ref> [365 AD]). 
                    Ammianus’ narrative, which begins in 353 AD, does not mention him. Maiorinus’ son was a <foreign>protégée</foreign> of Libanius and in one of his letters, the author referred to his father’s high offices as μεγίστη ἀρχή, an expression always associated with the praetorian prefecture (<ref type="source">Lib., Ep. 0474</ref>; <ref type="source">Lib., Ep. 0560</ref>; see also Feissel 2006, p. 125, nt. 148 and Sartre-Fauriat 2014, p. 307). 
                    The series of praetorian prefects for the years 337-357 AD has a gap for the holder of the Eastern prefecture between July 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 344 AD, when the prefect Domitius Leontius (see <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret22">PPRET 22</ref>, <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret24">PPRET 24</ref>) is attested for the last time (<ref type="source">CTh 13, 04, 03</ref>), and July 28<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 346 AD, when the prefect Flavius Philippus (see <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret27">PPRET 27</ref>; <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret28">PPRET 28</ref>; <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret29">PPRET 29</ref>; <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret31">PPRET 31</ref>) is attested for the first time (<ref type="source">CTh 11, 22, 01</ref>, on the constitution see Cuneo 1997, p. 146). 
                    Since the praetorian prefects of the East in the decade running from 346 to 357 AD are known (Philippus, Thalassius, Domitianus, Musonianus), that is to say in the period before Libanius’ letters 560 and 1510, it seems possible that Maiorinus was prefect of the East in the two-year period 344-346 AD (see also Laniado 2018, pp. 416-417; otherwise T.D. Barnes 1992, p. 255 inclines for a later chronology: 351/354 AD).</p>
                <p>Our two epigrams tell us that Maiorinus was buried on the plateau of Trachôn. The epigrams show that Maiorinus belonged to a small group of followers who were loyal to more than one emperor (ll. 5-6: πιστοτάτου βασιλ̣εῦσιν ἀμωμήτοιό τε κέρτου), and that his nephew Philippus continued this allegiance (ll. 10-11: καὐτὸς ἐὼν βασιλῆος ἀμύμονος ἐσλὸς ὀπάων). If its prefecture began in 344 AD, the emperors could be Constantine and Constantius II.</p>
                <p>It is possible that two other Greek inscriptions reveal our prefect’s ties with this area:</p>
                <p>(W 2476) + Χρ(ιστέ), βο(ήθει) Μαιουρίνῳ. (see IGLS XV／1, 243)</p>
                <p>(W 2472) + Φλ(αούιος) Χρυσάφιος ἔκτισεν τὸν ναὸν τοῦ ἁγίου Σεργίου /
                    ἐξ ὑποβωλῆς τοῦ τῆς μακαρίας μνήμης Ἠλία ἀδελφοῦ λογωθέτου /
                    Εὐανγέλου δὲ πρεσβ(υτέρου) προσφέροντος τὸ πρὶν ἔνθα ἀπόθητον /
                    μετὰ ἁψίδων καὶ πλακώσεως· διὸ ἐνθάδε κῖται· ἐξ ἐπιμελίας δὲ /
                    Ἠλία ἀρχιδ(ιακόνου), γένους Μαιουρίνου· ἔτους υιβ’ τῆς ἐπαρχ(είας), χρόνον ια’ ἰνδικ(τιῶνος). (see IGLS XV／1, 235)</p>
                <p>The last two inscriptions both came from the same building in Buşr al-Hariri, the great church of Saint Sergius. The first is roughly chiselled on a stone within, while the second sits upon the architrave of the church gate and could date to 517 AD. If Μαιουρῖνος is our Maiorinus or a relative of him, through the first inscription, we can deduce that he was probably christian (in fact many of the epigrams are addressed to christians in the Busr Al-Hariri area). The second shows that he belonged to a powerful senatorial family that was already well established in this area and that was still relevant in 517 AD, when the archdeacon Elia boasted of having γένους Mαιουρίνου (another fact that could demonstrate Maiorinus was christian, see Sartre-Fauriat 2014, p. 308).</p>
                <p>These epitaphs were made by his nephew and not by his son. According to Sartre-Fauriat, this was because Maiorinus’ son became so familiar with a rhetorician rival to Libanius (<ref type="source">Lib., Ep. 1118</ref>; <ref type="source">Lib., Ep. 1285</ref>) that he was no longer considered part of the family (see Sartre-Fauriat 2014, p. 307). 
                    Cugusi identified him as the praetorian prefect Flavius Philippus (PLRE I, p. 696; see Cugusi 2011, p. 208), since he too was of oriental origins, was prefect not long after Maiorinus (344-352 AD) and was much trusted by the emperors (ll. 10-11: καὐτὸς ἐὼν βασιλῆος ἀμύμονος ἐσλὸς ὀπάων). 
                    If this identification is correct, then it would be plausible to assume that his nephew (and not his son) erected these monuments in order to celebrate their common prestigious careers. A much simpler hypothesis put foward by Feissel suggests that if the son of Maiorinus had happened to die before his father, then he would not have been able to make the tomb (see Feissel 2006, p. 125 nt. 149).</p>
                <p>That said, the only way someone like Philippus was ever going to obtain such an important position, so close to the emporer, was by belonging to the generation following Maiorinus. He therefore had to be Maiorinus’ nephew and not his sister’s nephew, as Feissel suggests (see Feissel p. 125; Sartre-Fauriat 2014, p. 307). According to the reading of Waddington (1870), Robert and also more recently Merkelbach and Stauber, the word “<foreign>grati</foreign>” (l. 6) in the Latin text, is interpreted as the name of a second nephew “<foreign>Gratus</foreign>”, but Feissel rightly demonstrates through a comparison with the Greek text (ll. 7-10) that there was only one dedicant nephew, Philippus (see Feissel 2006, pp. 125-126): the Greek epigram does not mention any <foreign>Gratus</foreign>.</p>
                <p>Both inscriptions are in dactylic hexameters (four in Latin and ten in Greek) but contain imprecisions (see Cugusi 2011, p. 207). They are evidently inspired by classical Greek and Latin literature and used stereotyped formulas, revealing a good knowledge of the classical authors. 
                    Given the quality of the other epigrams found in and around Hauran, it is clear that this area had deep ties with classical culture. 
                    There are, nevertheless, some formal differences between the two epigrams: the Latin text is sober and shorter than the Greek hexameters, that are numerous and more complex. 
                    The praise of the deceased in the Greek text takes its inspiration from Homeric heroes, and the personification of the cardinal points is another Homeric reference (see Sartre Fauriat 2014, p. 307). This articulate metaphor describing the extension of his fame (Greek ll. 3-7) became the synthetic <foreign>per orbem</foreign> (Latin l. 3) in the Latin text. 
                    Cugusi (2011, p. 208) also noticed that the Latin <foreign>formula iacendi</foreign> (l. 1) is inspired by a pseudo-Virgilian epigram. However, the epigram in Latin shows more serious metric, grammatical and orthographical problems than the Greek epigram. The dactylic metrics of Latin verses 1-3 is seriously incorrect. 
                    Feissel (2006b, nt. 152) and Fauriat-Sartre (IGLS XV／1, 242) have tried to correct the meter of the second verse by attributing <foreign>magna(m)</foreign> to <foreign>orbem</foreign>, but such a solution is not entirely satisfactory. 
                    As noted by Feissel (ibidem) «la deuxième personne est cependant embarrassante, en raison du passage à la troisième personne au vers 3 (où l’on attendrait <foreign>tibi</foreign> plutôt que <foreign>illi</foreign>)»; stylistically the Greek epigram is much better than the Latin one. 
                    The author and the stone-cutter in Syria were not Latin-speaking: the orthographical variations in Latin are too many in only four verses, but they do not correct the metrics (<foreign>praetori</foreign> for <foreign>praetorio</foreign>, <foreign>caelebratus</foreign> for <foreign>celebratus</foreign>, <foreign>nuc</foreign> for <foreign>nunc</foreign> – a mistake –, <foreign>sedis</foreign> for <foreign>sedes</foreign>; the first enclitic <foreign>-que</foreign> is metrically useless without the desinence <foreign>-io</foreign>; the second one is useful for metrics but not for grammar).</p>
                <p>Since our Latin epitaph is the only one found among all the Greek epigrams from the Hauran area, the choice of using Latin must be related to the high political role of the prefect. Indeed, a Latin epitaph in verse, in a Greek-speaking area was the exclusive prerogative of an elite, a privilege reserved for the highest offices of the Eastern empire (Feissel 2006, p. 126; Cugusi 2011, p. 208). In addition to the Latin epitaph, Philippus decided to be even more gushing in his praise of Maiorinus in Greek: the prefect’s epitaph had to be read and understood also by local people who passed in front of the tomb.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, the oncial writing of the Latin text is also interesting. The stone-cutter copied the inscription using the same script as the draft. He was evidently accustomed to the oncial script, which was used for normative texts between the 3rd and 4th Centuries, even in the Greek-speaking area. To see a documentary style of writing in an epigraphic context is significant (see <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret53">PPRET 53</ref>).</p>
