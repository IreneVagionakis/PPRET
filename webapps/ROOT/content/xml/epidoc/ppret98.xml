                <p>This marble fragment was discovered in the area of Trajan’s Forum in Rome. It preserves a small portion of the front (left-side) of a statue base. A portion of the moulding that delimited the epigraphic field and the beginning of nine lines of text have survived. The beginning of the text and its ending is also missing. Despite its fragmentary condition, the remains of a <foreign>cursus honorum</foreign> (ll. 1-4) can still be discerned, followed by references to emperors (ll. 5-6) and the Senate (l. 8). Considering that it was found in one of the most prestigious squares of Rome, the fragment probably belonged to an honorary monument set up for an imperial official (on Trajan’s Forum in Late Antiquity, see Bauer 1996, pp. 93-97, 409-412; Niquet 2000, pp. 18-20; Chenault 2012, pp. 118-124, 130-131; from the same Forum comes also <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret46">PPRET 46</ref>, <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret48">48</ref>, <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret51">51</ref>, <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret54">54</ref>, <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret62">62</ref>, <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret93">93</ref>). The text was first published in 1982 by G. Fransoni (Fransoni 1982, pp. 657-658, with pl. XXIII, 2 = <ref type="inscription">AE 1985, 0044</ref>; cf. Bauer 1996, p. 411) and re-edited in 2000 as <ref type="inscription">CIL 06, 41380</ref> by F. Mitthof.</p>
<p>From the few surviving letters, we can see that the monument was decreed by two emperors (l. 5: <foreign>dd(omini) n[n(ostri)]</foreign>), probably with the approval or at the request of the Senate (l. 6: <foreign>sena[tu</foreign> ?; cf. <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret46">PPRET 46</ref> and <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret48">48</ref>, <foreign>adprobante amplissimo senatu</foreign>; cf. <foreign>petente senatu</foreign> in <ref type="inscription">CIL 06, 01710</ref> (cf. p. 4740) = <ref type="inscription">IG 14, 01074</ref> = <ref type="inscription">ILS 2949</ref> = <ref type="inscription">IGUR 01, 0063</ref> = Camodeca, Solin 2000, nr. 48 = <ref type="inscription" corresp="http://laststatues.classics.ox.ac.uk/database/detail-base.php?record=LSA-1355">LSA 1355</ref> = <ref type="inscription" corresp="http://www.edr-edr.it/edr_programmi/res_complex_comune.php?id_nr=EDR111227">EDR 111227</ref>; <foreign>testimonio senatus</foreign> in <ref type="inscription">CIL 06, 01683</ref> = <ref type="inscription">ILS 1221</ref> = <ref type="inscription" corresp="http://laststatues.classics.ox.ac.uk/database/detail-base.php?record=LSA-1395">LSA 1395</ref> = <ref type="inscription" corresp="http://www.edr-edr.it/edr_programmi/res_complex_comune.php?id_nr=EDR130290">EDR 130290</ref>; <foreign>petitione senatus</foreign> in <ref type="inscription">CIL 06, 01715</ref> = <ref type="inscription">CIL 06, 31910</ref> = <ref type="inscription">IG 14, 01075</ref> = <ref type="inscription">IGUR 01, 0065</ref> = <ref type="inscription">ILS 1274</ref> = <ref type="inscription" corresp="http://laststatues.classics.ox.ac.uk/database/detail-base.php?record=LSA-1418">LSA 1418</ref> = <ref type="inscription" corresp="http://www.edr-edr.it/edr_programmi/res_complex_comune.php?id_nr=EDR111228">EDR 111228</ref>; <foreign>petitu senatus amplissimi</foreign> in <ref type="inscription">CIL 06, 01725</ref> = <ref type="inscription">ILS 1284</ref> = <ref type="inscription" corresp="http://laststatues.classics.ox.ac.uk/database/detail-base.php?record=LSA-1407">LSA 1407</ref> = <ref type="inscription" corresp="http://www.edr-edr.it/edr_programmi/res_complex_comune.php?id_nr=EDR136330">EDR 136330</ref>; <foreign>adpetitione senatus amplissimi</foreign> in <ref type="inscription">CIL 06, 01749</ref> = <ref type="inscription">ILS 0809</ref> = <ref type="inscription" corresp="http://laststatues.classics.ox.ac.uk/database/detail-base.php?record=LSA-1458">LSA 1458</ref> = <ref type="inscription" corresp="http://www.edr-edr.it/edr_programmi/res_complex_comune.php?id_nr=EDR122364">EDR 122364</ref>). In l. 7, <foreign>inn[- - -]</foreign> may be part of the sentence that gave the motivation for the setting up of the statue to the official (<foreign>ob innumerabilia merita / beneficia?</foreign>). The dedications by two emperors and the evidence from Trajan’s Forum would place the career of the honorand sometime between the reign of Constantius II and Constans (from 340 AD) and the reign of Theodosius II and Valentinianus III (to 450 AD; cf. <ref type="inscription" corresp="http://laststatues.classics.ox.ac.uk/database/detail-base.php?record=LSA-405">LSA 0405</ref>.) His <foreign>cursus honorum</foreign> possibly listed the posts of a provincial governor (l. 1: <foreign>prae[sidi</foreign>), <foreign>magister</foreign> (l. 2: <foreign>mag[istro</foreign>) and another position also involving the administration of Africa (l. 4: <foreign>et Afr[icae</foreign>) that could be taken as a praetorian prefecture of Italy and Africa (and maybe Illyricum). At the beginning of l. 3, Mitthof (<ref type="inscription">CIL 06, 41380</ref>) suggests to interpret <foreign>secun[do</foreign>, as an indication of the iteration of the praetorian prefecture. Giving the sequence “provincial governor, …, <foreign>magister</foreign>, …, two times praetorian prefect” (at least the second term over Italy and Africa), the scholar has proposed Flavius Mallius Theodorus as the possible identity of the man being honoured (PLRE I, Theodorus 27, pp. 900-902; cf. Delmaire 1989, pp. 78-84; De Bonfils 1998, pp. 215-259; Olszaniec 2013, pp. 417-424).</p>
<p>The career of Theodorus is mainly known from the panegyric that Claudian delivered in his honour, when he was awarded the consulate in 399 AD (<ref type="source">Claud., Paneg. dictus Manlio Theodoro cos.</ref>). The poet gives a lengthy description of the virtues displayed by this official during his time in office. Probably of humble origin and a native of Northern Italy, he started his career as an advocate in the court of the praetorian prefecture (<ref type="source">Claud., Paneg. dictus Manlio Theodoro cos., 21-23</ref>). The first honour conferred upon Theodorus was the administration of an African province (<ref type="source">Claud., Paneg. dictus Manlio Theodoro cos., 24-27</ref>.) His identification as the honorand in Trajan’s Forum, allows to narrow down his governorship to one of the three provinces of the diocese ruled by <foreign>praesides</foreign>, that is to say Tripolitania, Mauretania Sitifensis and Mauretania Caesariensis (Mitthof suggests Tripolitania, but cf. Tantillo, Bigi 2010, p. 30, nr. 28). After his service in Africa, Theodorus was entrusted with the provincial governorship of Macedonia (<ref type="source">Claud., Paneg. dictus Manlio Theodoro cos., 28-32</ref>), this time of consular rank. Theodorus was then summoned to the court: Claudian’s words suggest that he was appointed imperial quaestor before being made count of the sacred largesses (<ref type="source">Claud., Paneg. dictus Manlio Theodoro cos., 33-41</ref>). However this sequence seems unlikely, since the office of quaestor ranked higher than that of a count. Moreover, a constitution of the emperor Gratian attests to Theodorus working in 380 AD as a count of the privy purse and not a count of the sacred largesses (<ref type="source">CTh 11, 16, 12</ref>). It has therefore been proposed that Theodorus was first nominated to the lower position of master of the memory before being elevated to the office of count of the privy purse (PLRE I, p. 901; Delmaire 1989, pp. 80-82; Olszaniec 2013, pp. 418-419; but cf. Harries 1988, pp. 181-182). In 382 AD Theodorus was probably promoted to the praetorian prefecture of Gauls (<ref type="source">Claud., Paneg. dictus Manlio Theodoro cos., 42-57</ref>). According to Claudian (<ref type="source">Claud., Paneg. dictus Manlio Theodoro cos., 58-60</ref>), all the offices, with the exception of one, were held by Theodorus continuously and this means that the first part of his career was entirely spent under the reign of the emperor Gratian (cf. Matthews 1975, p. 74). The praetorian prefecture of Gauls was followed by a long retirement from public office, during which time Theodorus devoted himself to literature and philosophy. His short treatise <title>De Metris</title> (Romanini 2007) has survived, but Claudian also refers to other interests, such as Greek philosophy, physics and astronomy (see Cameron 1970, pp. 323-327). After a fifteen-year gap, Theodorus was recalled by Honorius and made the praetorian prefect of Italy, Africa and Illyricum (Matthews 1975, pp. 262-263). This tenure, that lasted from January 397 AD to the beginning of 399 AD, is also attested by a large number of constitutions in the Theodosian and Justinian Codes (a list is in PLRE I, p. 901; Theodorus was replaced by Messalla, who is first attested in service on February 16th 399 AD: see PLRE II, Messalla 3, pp. 760-761). Finally, in 399 AD Theodorus received the supreme honour of the consulate (CLRE, pp. 332-333).</p>
<p>Retaining the partially attested offices of <foreign>praeses</foreign> (l. 1) and <foreign>magister memoriae</foreign> (l. 2), Mitthof (<ref type="inscription">CIL 06, 41380</ref>) has proposed to integrate in the second part of the first two lines the other positions of <foreign>consularis Macedoniae</foreign> (l. 1) and <foreign>comes rerum privatarum</foreign> (l. 2). The praetorian prefectures would have been registered in ll. 3-4 of the inscription, with the reference to the office introduced by <foreign>secundo</foreign> to indicate the iteration and followed by the list of the four areas that Theodorus administered (for the epigraphic attestations of <foreign>secundo</foreign>, sometimes recorded before the office that was held twice, see <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret96">PPRET 96</ref>). Mitthof also integrates on l. 4 the consulate of 399 AD and suggests that the statue in Trajan’s Forum might have been set up during that year. If this chronology is right, the imperial pair might be identified as Arcadius and Honorius. Here is Mitthof’s proposal of integration of ll. 1-6: <foreign>prae[sidi Tripolitanae?, consulari Macedoniae], | magi[stro memoriae, comiti rerum privatarum], | secun[do praef(ecto) praet(orio) Galliarum Illyrici Italiae] | et Afr[icae, consuli ordinario (vac.)?]. | dd(omini) n[n(ostri) FFll(avii) Arcadius et Honorius - - -] | prin[cipes semper Augusti - - -] | inn[umerabil- - -] | sena[tu- - -] | MET[- - -] |+++[- - -] | - - - - - -.</foreign></p>
<p>Although highly ingenious, Mitthof’s identification still leaves doubts, which is normal given the fragmentary condition of the text. The main problem is the hypothetical width of the epigraphic field. The <foreign>cursus honorum</foreign> that he has proposed requests the chiselling of 37-41 letters on each of the first three lines of the inscription which is much more than that normally encountered in similar monuments in Trajan’s Forum: 25-30 letters in the <foreign>cursus</foreign> of Saturninius Secundus Salutius, whose statue base, now lost, was one of the highest counts found in public spaces in Rome (<ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret51">PPRET 51</ref>, ll. 2-6); an average of 30 letters in the inscriptions dedicated to Eugenius (<ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret48">PPRET 48</ref>, ll. 2-5) and Flavius Taurus (<ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret46">PPRET 46</ref>, ll. 4-6), only 15-20 letters per line in the <foreign>cursus</foreign> of Flavius Sallustius (<ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret54">PPRET 54</ref>, ll. 2-7; but letters have a larger size on this inscription). The identification of the honorand as Theodorus thus implies exceptional dimensions for the statue base or an abundant use of abbreviations, which, however, are rarely attested in these monuments (only the prefecture in <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret46">PPRET 46</ref> and <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret51">51</ref>, <foreign>praef(ecto) praet(orio) / praetorio</foreign>, the prefecture and the consulate in <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret54">PPRET 54</ref>, <foreign>cons(uli) ordinario, praef(ecto) praet(orio)</foreign>; no abbreviation for any office in <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret48">PPRET 48</ref>). Highly problematic is l. 3, where <foreign>secun[do</foreign> (or <foreign>secundi</foreign>, see below), was probably recorded in full on the inscription. Following the integration of Mitthof, this would imply the abbreviation of any reference to the exceptional honour of a praetorian prefecture over Gauls, Italy, Illyricum and Africa that Theodorus held in two appointments (in his proposal, above, Mitthof only registers the office in its abbreviated form; cf. the occurrence of the same sequence, praetorian prefecture and four areas, in <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret65">PPRET 65</ref> and <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret66">66</ref>, that were however displayed in private spaces).</p>
<p>The identification of the offices that are preserved, albeit only partially, are also troublesome: <foreign>prae[</foreign>… (l.1) may also refer to a prefecture, perhaps of the <foreign>annona</foreign> considering its position in the <foreign>cursus</foreign>; <foreign>secun</foreign>… (l.3) to a <foreign>comitiva</foreign> of the second order (<foreign>comiti ordinis] | secun[di</foreign>; for the few epigraphical attestations of this honour, see Scharf 1994, pp. 62-65; cf. Fransoni 1982, pp. 657-658). Any one of these alternatives would be more convincing if they actually allowed us to identify the man being honoured, but they do not. Only the integration <foreign>magister officiorum</foreign> at the beginning of l. 2, instead of the lower position of <foreign>magister memoriae</foreign>, may suggest another candidate: Hadrianus (PLRE I, Hadrianus 2, p. 406; Delmaire 1989, pp. 137-141). A native of Alexandria, he too saw service in the West under Honorius and was master of the offices in 397-399 AD and then praetorian prefect of Italy and Africa in 401-405 AD and a second time in 413-414 AD. <foreign>Secundo</foreign> may be related to this double praetorian prefecture and the chronology would fit the dedication of the monument by an imperial college made up of two emperors (on this occasion Honorius and Theodosius II). However, Hadrianus was count of the sacred largesses before being nominated master of the offices (no information survives on his previous career). The registration of that position on l. 1 would again pose the problem of the width of the epigraphic field (because <foreign>prae</foreign>… at beginning of the line must refer to another tenure), without giving any solution for the filling of l. 2 after the office of <foreign>magister officiorum</foreign>.</p>
<p>In spite of these problems, Mitthof’s reading still deserves credit for suggesting a longer career of the honorand before his appointment to the praetorian prefecture, that would otherwise be unlikely after only a low-ranking provincial governorship and another, presumably palatine, office. His proposal has also the merit of providing a suitable candidate, Fl. Manlius Theodorus, whose <foreign>cursus honorum</foreign> would fit the indications of our fragment.</p>
