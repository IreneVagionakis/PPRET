                            <p>[*]   Some remarks on the 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> section - Provenance and location:</p>
                            <p>- ‘Province’: the term ‘Urbs’ refers to the urban area under the control of the prefect of Rome (praef. Urbi), distinguishing it from the surrounding provinces of Campania, Flaminia et Picenum and Tuscia et Umbria which were all administered by provincial governors.</p>
                            <p>- ‘Regional prefecture’: the expression ‘not regional before 326 AD’ indicates that in our opinion the praetorian prefecture became regional only from 326 AD onwards, as a result of Constantine I’s administrative reform. Furthermore, the praetorian prefecture of ‘Italia Illyricum Africa’ had different administrative boundaries during the 4th Century. For simplicity we always refer to it as ‘Italia Illyricum Africa’, but in our opinion it was enlarged and reduced in the following way: 326-337 AD: Italia, Illyricum, Africa = three autonomous and distinct prefectures (perhaps Italia and Africa united at the beginning of 337 AD); 337-344 AD = one single prefecture of Italia, Illyricum, Africa united; 344-361 AD = one prefecture of Italia and Africa united, one autonomous prefecture of Illyricum; 361-376 = one single prefecture of Italia, Illyricum, Africa united; 376 AD ff. = one prefecture of Italia and Africa, one autonomous prefecture of Illyricum.</p>

                                <item><emph>Date</emph>: this section allows users to search PPRET Inscriptions entries within chronological ranges.</item>

                            </list>
                            <p>Filters can be combined with the parameters selected in the other sections to further refine a search. When one or more filters have been selected, the indication ‘Current filters’ appears in the left column above ‘Filters’: the selection can be deactivated by clicking on the (x) to proceed to a new search.</p>

                                <p>If users want to perform a specific textual search (both in the ancient texts and in the other parts of the editions, namely the metadata, translations, commentary, and bibliography), they can type their text in the ‘<emph>Text search</emph>’ box and then click ‘Enter’. PPRET Inscriptions entries mentioning the word(s) searched for (ancient name, modern author, place, source, date, etc.) will be listed as results in the right column. In each entry, the word that has been researched will be highlighted in red. Text searches are not case-sensitive. </p>
                                <p>By selecting the option ‘<emph>Search only in the inscription text</emph>’, users will restrict the search to the Latin or Greek text of the inscriptions. The search ignores epigraphic conventions (such as round and square brackets).</p>
                                <p>Users can use the * wildcard to search for segments of words: for example, a search for <foreign>nobilita</foreign>* will return <foreign>nobilitas</foreign>, <foreign>nobilitatis</foreign>, <foreign>nobilitate</foreign>, and so on.</p>
                                <p>If the search includes several consecutive words, you should surround them with double quotation marks (" "): for example, to search for <foreign>viro</foreign> followed by <foreign>clarissimo</foreign>, you should type "<foreign>viro clarissimo</foreign>". Attention: when you perform a precise search for a sequence of several words, you cannot use the wildcard *.</p>
                                <p>If the search includes several consecutive words, users should surround them with double quotation marks (" "): for example, to search for <foreign>viro</foreign> followed by <foreign>clarissimo</foreign>, one should type "<foreign>viro clarissimo</foreign>". If the double quotation marks (" ") are not inserted, then the search will furnish all the inscriptions (i.e. entries) in which at least one of the researched words appears. N.B., when users perform a precise search for a sequence of several words,  the wildcard * cannot be used.</p>
                                <p>If the search includes several non-consecutive words, users should type the Boolean search AND between the words they wish to search (which in this case must not be placed within double quotation marks " "), so that the list of results will list the inscriptions (i.e. entries) in which all the typed words are cited: for example, typing <foreign>viro</foreign> AND <foreign>clarissimo</foreign> will produce a list of inscriptions (i.e. entries) in which both terms appear.</p>
                                <p>Typing <foreign>viro clarissimo</foreign> (or <foreign>viro</foreign> OR <foreign>clarissimo</foreign>) will provide a list of inscriptions (i.e. entries) in which at least one of the researched words appears.</p>
                                <p>To search and type Greek words users can use the virtual keyboard that appears under the search box by pressing 'Greek keyboard'. In the lower right corner of the keyboard users will also find the wildcard *, double quotation marks " and the Delete key ⇐. To hide the keyboard, one has to click 'Greek keyboard' again. To reset the search, click 'Reset search'.</p>

                                <p>N.B., the following two sections 'Date' and 'Filters' allow users to select and employ several search filters (even simultaneously), which refines the search. If one or more filters from these sections are selected and active, 'Current filters' appears above the 'Filters' section. Should one wish to remove specific search filters that have been selected, click on the (x) to the right of the corresponding filter in the 'Current filters' section (or click 'Reset search' to remove all filters).</p>
