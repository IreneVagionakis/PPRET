                            <p>The <emph>Results</emph> column on the right shows the list of records found via the search; to see the individual record, you need to select it in this column.

                                <p>If you want to perform a specific textual search (both in the ancient texts and in the other parts of the editions, namely the metadata, translations, commentary, and bibliography), you can type your text in the ‘<emph>Text search</emph>’ box in the ‘Search’ page and then press ‘Enter’. PPRET Inscriptions records mentioning the word(s) you searched for (ancient name, modern author, place, source, date, etc.) will be listed as results in the column on the right. Text searches are not case-sensitive.</p>
                                <p>If you select the option '<emph>Search only in the inscription text</emph>' you will restrict the search to the Latin or Greek text of the inscriptions. The search ignores epigraphic conventions (such as round and square brackets).</p>
                                <p>You can use the * wildcard to search for segments of words: for example, a search for <foreign>nobilita</foreign>* will return <foreign>nobilitas</foreign>, <foreign>nobilitatis</foreign>, <foreign>nobilitate</foreign>, and so on.</p>
                                <p>If the search includes several consecutive words, you should surround them with double quotation marks (" "): for example, to search for <foreign>viro</foreign> followed by <foreign>clarissimo</foreign>, you should type "<foreign>viro clarissimo</foreign>". Attention: when you perform a precise search for a sequence of several words, you cannot use the wildcard *.</p>
                                <p>If the search includes several non-consecutive words, you should type the boolean search AND between the words you want to search (which in this case must not be in the double quotation marks " "), so that the list of results will include the records in which all the words typed are cited: for example, typing <foreign>viro</foreign> AND <foreign>clarissimo</foreign> you will get a list of records in which both terms appear.
                                    By typing <foreign>viro clarissimo</foreign> (or <foreign>viro</foreign> OR <foreign>clarissimo</foreign>) you will get a list of records where at least one of the searched words appears.</p>
                                <p>To type Greek text you can use the virtual keyboard that appears under the search box by pressing 'Greek keyboard'. In the lower right corner of the keyboard you will also find the wildcard *, double quotation marks " and the Delete key ⇐. To hide the keyboard, you have to press 'Greek keyboard' again.</p>
                                <p>To reset your search, press 'Reset search'.</p>
                                <p>Attention: The following sections 'Date' and 'Filters' allow you to set several search filters, which affect the text search. If one or more filters from these sections are selected and active, 'Current filters' appears above the 'Filters' section. If you want to remove specific search filters that you have selected, click on the 'x' to the right of the corresponding filter in the 'Current filters' section.</p>
