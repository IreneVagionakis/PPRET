            </div>
            <div type="commentary">
                <p>The inscription was found in the ancient site of Aire / Αἴρη (Barrington Atlas, tab. 69; Sartre 1999, fig. 1; IGLS 14/1 Carte de la Syrie du Sud) on the Roman road connecting Damascus-Airè-Neve-Capitolias, now Sanamein (« the two idols »), 50 km South of Damascus in Syria. Aire / Sanamein is located in the northern part of the Batanea, the plain between Mount Hermon to the North, the Galaunitis massifs to the West and Trachonitis to the East, in the province of Phoenices Libanensis, bordering the province of Arabia (concerning Batanea, cf. Dentzer 1985; A. and M. Sartre in IGLS 14/1, pp. 3-20; on Aire cf. IGLS 14/2, pp. 529-532). 
                    Since the High Empire Aire had been the administrative seat of an imperial <foreign>saltus</foreign>. The latter is attested by our inscription (l. 6), and by three other inscriptions dating to the 2nd/3rd Century AD, which mention imperial <foreign>procuratores</foreign> in the same locality (IGLS 14/2 nr. 0554, 0555, 0561b; on legionaries in this area, especially belonging to the <foreign>legio III Gallica</foreign> cf. IGLS 14/1, p. 16). 
                    Although the sources are silent, Aire may have been a civitas in the Late Empire, since it was already the seat of a bishop in 325 AD and again in 451 AD; but it may have been one of the metrokômiai of Syria (on this type of administrative and commercial centre, see Dagron 1979, Sartre 1999 and with different opinions Gnoli 2013; synthesis by Carrié 2012, pp. 45-46), although no source attributes the title of metrokômia to Aire (cf. IGLS 14/2, p. 534).</p>
                <p>The base was found in 1997 in Aire / Sanamein, along a road about 50 m North-West of the sanctuary of Tyche / Fortune (the <foreign>Tychaeion</foreign>) and now it lies in the garden of a house near the remains of the same temple (the details of the discovery and possible reuse of the base in later structures are not known, and the information in IGLS 14/2, no. 0555a and 0556a is not coherent). 
                    The <foreign>Tychaeion</foreign> was built in 191 AD and consisted of a building of about 12 m by 12 m, which is still visible (for the dedication of the temple, see IGLS 14, 0548; on this building cf. Freyberger 1989; Freyberger 2010, pp. 488-490, Abb. 30, 31; Oenbrink 2000; Clauss-Balty 2008, pp. 272-276.) A topographical link between the monumental area of the <foreign>Tychaeion</foreign>, and the neighbouring Temple of Zeus Airèsios or Kyrios, and the base in honour of the praetorian prefect seems very likely. 
                    The inscription is in fact ophistographic: on the two opposite sides, left and right with respect to the epigraphic field of our inscription, two parts of the same inscription in Greek were engraved simultaneously (IGLS 14/2, nr. 0556a). The opistographic text celebrates the offering of the statue of a child (Zenodôros), which was consecrated to the deity together with an offering of four candlesticks by the father (Moschion) priest of the ‘Great Tyche.’ 
                    This double inscription, dating from the 3rd Century AD, is the oldest. The dedication to the praetorian prefect was probably engraved around a century later in 355/360 AD. It is possible that the <foreign>Tycheion</foreign> of Aire was no longer in use at this time and that the inscribed base of Moschion could have been reused. 
                    The base of Moschion may have been moved from the Tycheion in front of or into the nearby seat of the administrative centre of the imperial <foreign>saltus</foreign> (see below), where the <foreign>procurator</foreign> Flavius Maximus had the monument to the praetorian prefect erected. 
                    The previous inscriptions on the two sides were not erased: perhaps they were plastered over, or the new inscription chiselled on the base was only visible from the front.</p>
                <p>The first line of the inscription in honour of the praetorian prefect was engraved just below the upper edge of the epigraphic field, and it is damaged on its right side. Since the praetorian prefect's name is lost in that space – but nothing else – one wonders whether it was not deliberately erased. 
                    The editor, who examined the inscription, does not put forward this hypothesis, and the photos do not clarify whether the name was erased (Gnoli 2013, p. 281, thinks that it was erased.)</p>
                <p>The monument honouring the anonymous praetorian prefect as the benefactor and saviour of the whole region of Batanea (l. 5) and its location lead to the conclusion that the dignitary was a praetorian prefect of the East. 
                    It is impossible to know in what way he favoured that region, but it is probable that his benevolance had certain fiscal and administrative ramifications. For praetorian prefects of the East celebrated as benefactors, see Fl. Philippus at Perge (<ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret29">PPRET 29</ref>), Strategius Musonianus at Hierapolis of Phrygia (<ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret43">PPRET 43</ref>), Vindaonius Anatolius at Perge (<ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret47">PPRET 47</ref>), Saturninus Secundus Salutius at Antioch of Pisidia (<ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret52">PPRET 52</ref>). 
                    For an Eastern prefect ‘saviour of cities,’ see <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret91">PPRET 91</ref>; a Greek expression similar to the previous ones in the inscription for the praetorian prefect of Italia Illyricum Africa Petronius Probus in Crete (<ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret58">PPRET 58</ref>, l. 9); a reference to the easing of tax burdens in the inscription for the prefect Antonius Marcellinus in Crete (<ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret21">PPRET 21</ref>). 
                    For dedications in Latin decreed by communities to praetorian prefects (not always as patrons), see <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret24">PPRET 24</ref>, <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret25">25</ref>, <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret32">32</ref>, <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret54">54</ref>, <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret59">59</ref>, <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret60">60</ref>, <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret61">61</ref>, <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret63">63</ref>, <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret73">73</ref>, <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret97">97</ref>.</p>
                <p>The anonymous praetorian prefect of the East cited in the inscription from Aire / Sanamein served under Constantius II Augustus and Iulianus Caesar (ll. 3-4) and therefore his mandate can be placed to the period between November 355 AD and February 360 AD. Three prefects of the East are known in this period: Strategius Musonianus, Hermogenes, Helpidius.</p>
                <p>Strategius Musonianus (PLRE I, pp. 611-612; see <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret42">PPRET 42</ref>, with biography; <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret43">PPRET 43</ref>, <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret44">44</ref>) was not an aristocrat by birth, but a confidant of Constantinus, who attained a high position through his cultural competence and reliability. He was of Phoenician origin (<ref type="source">Lib., Or. 01, 080</ref>), educated, a polyglot, correspondent of Libanius (Petit 1994, pp. 236-240), and a Christian with possible Arian tendencies. 
                    He served the emperor Constantius II both as a <foreign>comes</foreign> and as a diplomat. He was probably <foreign>praeses Thebaidos</foreign> in 349 AD,  he was certainly <foreign>proconsul</foreign> of Constantinople before 353 AD and <foreign>proconsul</foreign> of Achaia in 353 AD. After the lynching of the prefect of the East Domitianus (PLRE I, p. 262) in Antioch in 354 AD and the deposition of Constantius Gallus Caesar, Musonianus became the praetorian prefect of the East. 
                    He sat in office as prefect for the first time on July, 25th 354 AD (<ref type="source">CTh 08, 05, 05</ref>; <ref type="source">Amm. 15, 13, 01</ref>; <ref type="source">Lib., Or. 01, 106</ref>) and for the last time on June 7th 358 AD (<ref type="source">CTh 01, 05, 06-07</ref>). 
                    He was probably dismissed before the end of the Summer of 358 AD (<ref type="source">Lib., Ep. 0021</ref>), however before May 28th 359 AD (<ref type="source">CTh 01, 07, 01</ref>), when his successor Hermogenes became praetorian prefect. Musonianus’ power was extensive, particularly since the emperor Constantius II was away in Milan from 354 to 357, then in Sirmium from 357 to 359 AD. 
                    In that long period, from mid 354 AD at least until mid 358 AD, Musonianus was the most important civil authority in the Roman East. Ammianus (<ref type="source">Amm. 15, 13, 02</ref>) considers him a good administrator, very balanced in the government of the provinces, but prone to cruelty and greed in trials. 
                    If the name of the missing prefect in the first line of our inscription from Aire / Sanamein was erased, it is unlikely that the monument honoured Musonianus, because in two inscriptions from Hierapolis of Phrygia (<ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret43">PPRET 43</ref>, <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret44">44</ref>) and one from Paphos (<ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret42">PPRET 42</ref>) his name has remained intact.</p>
                <p>Hermogenes (PLRE I, p. 423 Hermogenes 8, but see Hermogenes 2 and 9), was native of Pontus; he was a cultured official, an expert in rhetoric, law and philosophy as well as being a correspondent of Libanius (Petit 1994, pp. 121-122). As mentioned, he was praetorian prefect perhaps from August 358 AD (<ref type="source">Lib., Ep. 0021</ref>; <ref type="source">Amm. 19, 12, 06</ref>) to early 360 AD (<ref type="source">Amm. 21, 06, 09</ref>, of uncertain chronology; <ref type="source">CTh 01, 07, 01</ref>, on May 28th 359 AD).</p>
                <p>Helpidius (PLRE I, p. 414) was native of Paphlagonia and of humble origins. Apart from serving as a <foreign>notarius</foreign>, his career is unknown. He may have been <foreign>praeses Mauretaniae Sitifensis</foreign> (<ref type="inscription">CIL 08, 20542</ref>) and <foreign>consularis Pannoniae</foreign> (<ref type="source">CTh 07, 20, 06</ref>) around 353 AD, but the two governors named Helpidius could be different from our prefect. He was nominated praetorian prefect of the East after Hermogenes, and remained in office from the beginning of 360 AD (the date February 4th 360 AD is cited by <ref type="source">CTh 11, 24, 01</ref>) and for almost the entire year of 361 AD. 
                    He remained faithful to Constantius II, until the emperor’s death in November 361 AD (his successor Salutius is in office in December 361 AD). Upon leaving the prefecture, Helpidius was in danger of being lynched by Iulianus Augustus’ troops and was only saved  by the intervention of this emperor (<ref type="source">Lib., Or. 37, 011</ref>; <ref type="source">Lib., Ep. 0740</ref>; <ref type="source">Amm. 22, 03, 01</ref>). The correspondence with Libanius is concentrated in this two-year period 360/361 AD (Petit 1994, pp. 87-89).</p>
                <p>It is likely that the praetorian prefect of the Aire / Sanamein inscription is Strategius Musonianus. The hypothesis is based on the length of his prefecture (four years), the political importance of this position, his Phoenician origin and his promotion of restoration works in the eastern cities (<ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret42">PPRET 42</ref> and <ref type="ppret" corresp="ppret44">44</ref>). Furthermore, in lines 4-5 of our inscription, the anonymous praetorian prefect is praised for the security he provided to the region of Batanea, before the reference to his role as «benefactor and saviour». 
                    The security of the eastern border was threatened from 359 AD, after the end of Musonianus’s mandate, but it is likely that the dedicators are referring to Musonianus’s control over all the eastern frontier from 354 AD onwards (cf. Lee 1993, pp. 106-112 and 172-173). 
                    Moreover, Musonianus, who is praised as a good administrator, may have carefully looked after the interests of the imperial properties in the <foreign>saltus</foreign> of Batanea and could count the <foreign>ducenarius</foreign> Maximus among his clients. The erasing of the prefect's name near the upper edge of the block would have thus occured  accidentally.</p>
                <p>The dedicator of  the Aire / Sanamein  monument is the personification of Batanea's plains, while the local authority responsible for its creation near the local <foreign>Tycheion</foreign> is the <foreign>ducenarius</foreign> of the <foreign>saltus</foreign>, Maximus (on the titles <foreign>praefectus / praepositus saltus</foreign> in late empire cf. Not. Dig. or. 14, 07; see Woods 1994; Bartels 2008). 
                    Since the name is a very common one, it is difficult to say whether our <foreign>vir perfectissimus</foreign> Maximus could be one of those provincial governors who are known to have served between 355 and 375 AD (cf. PLRE I, pp. 582-585). Everything suggests that Aire / Sanamein was the administrative seat of the <foreign>saltus</foreign>, which might explain why the institutional profile of the community of Aire was defined neither as a <foreign>civitas</foreign>, nor as a <foreign>metrokômia</foreign>. 
                    The size of the <foreign>saltus</foreign> is unknown, but it did not appear to infringe on the Nabataean kingdom to the South: it therefore seems likely that it was centred upon Herod’s family properties, perhaps already around 90 AD (see above). 
                    Concerning the productive and administrative imperial structures known as <foreign>saltus</foreign>, after Beaudouin 1897, cf. Soricelli 2004; on late imperial properties and their managment cf. Vera 2014; Lo Cascio 2015; the imperial estates in the East seems to be less extensive than in the West (Kaplan 1976).</p>
                <p>P. Porena would like to thank Professor M. Sartre for his invaluable help in compiling the bibliography for this inscription during the closures imposed by the pandemic.</p>
